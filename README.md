The HTML structure includes three main sections: the login section which allows users to enter their username before starting the quiz, quiz section which displays the questions and answer options, and the result section which shows the final score after completing the quiz. The CSS provides styling to make the quiz visually appealing and interactive. Key features include styling for buttons, layout, and feedback for correct/incorrect answers. The JavaScript handles the quiz logic, including displaying questions, handling user input, providing instant feedback, and calculating the final score. The one challenge I faced was getting the color to show up as green for correct and red for incorrect. To solve this problem I added “!important” next to where I styled the incorrect and correct button to make sure ensure that no matter what happens these colors will show.
